        Amber launches its new range of wireless headphones.
        We point out inequalities by highlighting three women whose journey, 
        struggles and actions have played an important role in the emancipation 
        and rights of women.

        Amber offers women under the slogan "moving woman" 
        dynamic support thanks to our new lightweight and colorful 
        in-ear headphones.

        Our new range offers comfort for all events, 
        sportswoman, mother, employee, boss, student or doctor.
        Amber will respond with our new products to all the needs of an 
        independent and strong woman.
